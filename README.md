# FireClassifier
An ML model for detecting fire in pictures.

# Summary: #
The code in this repo trains a model, using Keras/Tensorflow, to detect fires in images of landscapes using this [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset). Having come from a background in Multi-Agent Learning, I implemented this to familiarise myself with standard ML industry tools and supervised learning. The main novelty here is that I managed to do it with a relatively simple Neural Network (50x fewer parameters than some of the solutions on Kaggle) which I explain in more detail in the python notebook.


**Note:** 
The code here is based on the example in Chapter 5 of *Deep Learning with Python* by Francois Chollet. I have changed the network architecture, metrics, pre-processing etc to be more appropriate for the fire dataset.
